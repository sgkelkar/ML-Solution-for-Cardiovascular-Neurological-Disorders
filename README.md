## Results

#### Problem Set 1:
The decision tree models constructed exhibit promising performance, with notable concerns regarding overfitting. Strategies such as employing random forest, boosting, and bagging were implemented to address this issue.

#### Problem Set 2:
Upon evaluation, the decision tree model, specifically the Forest Tree algorithm, demonstrated superior performance. However, challenges persist regarding data consistency, impacting the reliability of predictions. Also, an unexpected trend was observed where the predictive accuracy degraded with repeated executions of the code, warranting further investigation.
